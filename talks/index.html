                    <h3>Upcoming Talks</h3>
                    <h4><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/144/">Sink or Swim: 5 life jackets to throw to New Coders</a></h4>
                    <p>PyCon, Santa Clara, March 2013</p>
                    <p>Many want to learn to code, and many choose Python as a first language. You direct them to Learn Python the Hard Way, or Dive into Python. Great! But now what? I will present 5 digestible projects to gradually progress the Python learner from near drowning to a decent swimmer. The goal is to have new coders feeling accomplished and to continuing learning.</p>
                    <h4><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/events/letslearnpython/">Tutorial: The Young Coder: Let's Learn Python</a></h4>
                    <p>PyCon, Santa Clara, March 2013, partnering with <a href="http://twitter.com/kcunning">Katie Cunningham</a></p>
                    <p>Aimed for teenagers, this free tutorial will explore how to program using Python by making games. We will start with learning Python's simple data types, including numbers, letters and strings, and lists. We will also explore comparisons, if-statements, and loops. Finally, we will combined our new knowledge by creating our own game using the PyGame library.</p>
                    <h4><a href="https://2013.djangocon.eu">Invited Speaker - Technical Talk (TBD)</a></h4>
                    <p>DjangoCon Europe, Warsaw, May 2013</p>

                    <h3>Previous Talks</h3>
                    <h4Community FTW: How can we make it better?</h4>
                    <p>RuPy, Brno, Czech Republic, November, 2012</p>
                    <h4>Keynote: Community FTW</h4>
                    <p>PyCarolinas, Chapel Hill, NC, October, 2012</p>
                    <p>I was honored when <a href="http://twitter.com/ironfroggy">Calvin Spealman</a> invited me to keynote on the topic of community.  He wanted folks to leave feeling inspired to build up the area's sense of community.  A lot of pressure, but having a conference is a damn good litmus test to understand a local area's Python community. When trying to develop my talk, during my procrastination/conference-driven-development, I tried to understand and uncover the inherit qualities of the Python community. But first I had to step back: *why* is community important? </p>

        <article><p>I had the wonderful opportunity to bring up a few fellow PyLadies to Portland, Oregon for O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Open Source Convention.  Thanks to the help of the <a href="http://www.psf.org" title="PSF">Python Software Foundation</a>, we were able to bring along swag including stickers, postcards of information on how to start a local PyLadies chapter, and a new banner. </p>

<p>It was an interesting experience.  There was a lot of excitement for the conference; the open-source community is fantastic to be a part of. But what was weird was that I felt there were not a lot of Pythonistas there.  Similarly, I felt PyLadies&#39; presence wasn&#39;t as well received as I originally anticipated.  I heard a lot of people walk by, asking &quot;pe... pilates? what&#39;s pilates?&quot; Interestingly enough, this gave me an event idea: &quot;PyLadies does Pilates!&quot; :D </p>

<p>The talk that I gave was a little awkward, too. Not many people showed up (bummer), and the majority of the folks that did were women.  That was actually pretty awesome to witness, but it was sort of preaching to the choir. :) One thing I do thoroughly enjoy is the conversation &amp; questions that come after my talks.  I&#39;m always blown away how everyone wants to get more women involved, and how welcoming new ideas and thoughts are to do such thing.</p>

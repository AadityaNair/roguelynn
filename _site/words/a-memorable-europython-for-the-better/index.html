        <h3>A memorable EuroPython, for the better</h2>
            <aside>
                <time pubdate datetime="2012-07-12">July 12, 2012</time>
            </aside>
        <article><p>EuroPython marked many memorable experiences for me, as a PyLady, as a member of the Python community, and as a newbie to coding &amp; programming. First, it is widely known and very well accepted that the folks at EuroPython did a fantastic job in organizing the whole conference. Every detail was well thought out.  Coming from 7000+ miles away, I did not feel like a foreigner.  Little things, including inviting me to join them in the evening a couple days before the conference; having cordial side conversations; and making connections &amp; introductions, it all really helped me out. </p>

<p>To be given an opportunity to speak about what I&#39;ve been doing with PyLadies in San Francisco and Women Who Code is fantastic; and to have it elevated to a keynote was all the more surreal.  I thought it was pretty well received by the audience.  Many folks asked really good, difficult questions; things that needed to be discussed.  My approach to the talk was to provoke some thought in the audience without really alienating them.  </p>

<p>Yet many still wanted to get to the elephant in the room: &quot;what are we doing that we don&#39;t know we&#39;re doing?&quot; Long answer short: It&#39;s not Python community-specific, but how we bring general societal norms into the community.  We, the python community, have been very open minded with who joins us.  I&#39;m not sure why, if it&#39;s a precedent that Guido set, if it&#39;s the type of people the language attracts, or if it&#39;s because it&#39;s the model child of FOSS. It&#39;s certainly a breath of fresh air compared to the likes of Java or C (no offense, well, maybe...). </p>

<p>Another hot question was &quot;Is Guido&#39;s t-shirt, Python is for Girls, sexist?&quot;  From the point of view of a woman, it ostracizes me.  It feels like someone is trying to dress up programming with the color pink.  Or like Lego trying to appeal to girls with <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Stephanie-s-Outdoor-Bakery-3930" title="Lego Backery">it&#39;s easy-bake oven twist</a>.  But when talking to Guido one-on-one, as I would have thought, he of course didn&#39;t mean it to be offensive.  Rather, he means to challenge the programmer paradigm. After the keynote, many approached me.  One gal from <a href="http://geekgirlscarrots.pl" title="Geek Girl Carrots">geekgirlscarrots.pl</a> gave me the greatest greeting and sincerest thank you I&#39;ve heard.  Men came up asking for help and ideas how to get more women involved in their communities back home.  I felt this talk was very well received (despite being so nervous for it!).</p>

<hr>

<p>The most-talked about event, in my opinion (probably because I was the center of it), was the incident outline in my <a href="/2012-07-05-really" title="Really">previous post</a>. Namely, a conference attendee tweeted something offensive in reference<br>
to #pyladies, I called him out, addressed it with the EuroPython organizers, and allowed a discussion (if you can call it that) happen on my blog. My first thought about that event: The organizers of EuroPython handled it exceptionally well.  I went to the venue early before the conference started for the day, and they were already aware of the tweet (and I assume my reaction to it via twitter or my blog, as well).  They were very diligent in consulting the appropriate people on the EuroPython/Python Italia board.  The result was, I felt, adequate in addressing the situation.  <a href="https://twitter.com/pwang/status/221172889813131264" title="Apology 1">A public apology</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/pwang/status/221196983031963654" title="Apology 2">two</a>, actually) from the attendee via twitter and <a href="http://www.roguelynn.com/2012/07/05/really/comment-page-1/#comment-5125" title="Apology Comment">on my blog</a>, a <a href="https://twitter.com/europython/status/221201258424442881" title="EuroPython Stance">public stance</a> on their <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/code-of-conduct" title="EuroPython CoC">Code of Conduct</a> via twitter, and plenty of reassurance in private. I can&#39;t stress enough that the organizers were very respectful, and did exactly what I thought should be done.  This is exactly why there needs to be a CoC at conferences, and why the Python community is very adamant about signing the <a href="http://letsgetlouder.com/" title="Lets Get Louder">Let&#39;s Get Louder campaign</a>. I&#39;d like to quote a comment on the Let&#39;s Get Louder campaign from someone who I met at EuroPython, but didn&#39;t know at the time of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/vroj4/python_programmers_sign_pledge_to_only/c579eeb" title="Hynek&#39;s Comment">when this was posted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s amazing how people who have never been affected by any type of<br>
discrimination decide for the rest, that it’s not a big deal and not<br>
our problem. But it *is* our problem.<br>
Because *this* is *our* community. And I will not tolerate that people<br>
get discriminated or harassed ... without any reaction<br>
from *inside* the community. Because that’s bad for our community. For<br>
every single person of us. A code of conduct is not about giving women<br>
or other minorities the power to get people they dislike out of<br>
conferences just by accusing them. So stop bringing that up. It is a<br>
firm statement by the organizers and everyone who decides to take part<br>
of such an event that *we* as a community value every member of it and<br>
don’t want assholes make them feel not welcome. That if someone<br>
harasses them we’ll be there for them and won’t just shrug our<br>
shoulders and/or relay cowardly responsibilities to ominous third<br>
parties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this incident happened, I <del>teared up a bit</del> cried. Not because I took the tweet to heart, but because I knew that I was in a safe space, here at the conference.  I had this comment in the back of my mind already, and to reflect back to it gave me some comfort.  I was comfortable showing up to the conference, having normal conversations with folks, and did not feel ostracized. The apology, while I don&#39;t doubt the sincerity, showed lack of cognizance &amp; self awareness of the issue at hand. For clarity: some people don&#39;t get it.  From another community that I shared this incident with, this response hits the point pretty well.  I want to illustrate a female point of view that I heavily agree with, but can&#39;t seem to voice it as well as her.  With her permission, I am posting anonymously:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without #Pyladies it&#39;s not a joke, it&#39;s just a contentless anecdote.<br>
The hash tag wasn&#39;t just accidental or in poor taste.  It would<br>
still have been sexist and offensive and objectifying and<br>
rape-culturish if he had tagged it &quot;#ladies?&quot;or &quot;#Wife?&quot;  (God<br>
forbid we say so though, or expect men to actually think about women<br>
as people instead of blow job machines.)  It is extra-special-nasty<br>
because he implied that specifically technical women who were where he<br>
was right then are *still* nothing more than objects for his sexual<br>
pleasure, and so it becomes a specific and personal<br>
threat/dehumanization of actual, specific women whom he could probably<br>
see at the time.  That is offensive and sexist and objectifying<br>
*and* creepy and discouraging and alienating and perpetuates the<br>
culture that creates the gross gender imbalances in our industry.<br>
Until these dudes start deconstructing their thoughts themselves,<br>
I will deconstruct their thoughts for them.  If they don&#39;t like<br>
what their jokes say about them, they should start thinking before<br>
they speak now shouldn&#39;t they? It is entirely possible to make dirty<br>
jokes that don&#39;t rely on a blind sense of entitlement to sexual<br>
relations with the generic category of &quot;women&quot; (or any other generic<br>
category, for that matter.)  For example, &quot;Sucked the marrow out of my<br>
osso bucco at #Europython.  Waiter said I will have &quot;very good<br>
orgasm.&quot; He was right. #Flexible&quot; Or &quot;Sucked the marrow out of my<br>
osso bucco Waiter said I will have &quot;very good orgasm.&quot; Wasn&#39;t<br>
practicing for me #LoveYouDear&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t an overreaction; this was a perfect situation to bring to light the type of incidents women do face.  Sure, maybe one comment can be easily brushed off.  But it isn&#39;t one, it&#39;s many.  From both in private at home with silly, innocuous jokes, to a\$\$hat comments made in public.  It adds up.  The general creepy comments from being the only female at a table drinking; the hurtful, disrespectful, and gaslighting tweets &amp; blog comments; the crass jokes; the &quot;calm down, just breathe. You&#39;re overreacting&quot; conversation (!). </p>

<p>For simple, lightbulb moments that I&#39;ve witnessed some men get, it&#39;s gratifying and reassuring.  It&#39;s the reason I&#39;m speaking.  The soft &quot;a-ha&quot; speaks loudly. The support that I got that evening and the rest of the conference was amazing. Some went up to bat on behalf of me/PyLadies/women in tech.  Some simply asked how I was doing. Overall, I could not have asked for a better experience.  I met many prolific and awesome people in the Python community.  I&#39;ve made friends that I know will last beyond the sunny days of Florence.  And I&#39;ve made a pretty hard dent in my liver.  I&#39;m looking forward to next year.</p>

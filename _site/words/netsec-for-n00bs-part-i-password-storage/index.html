        <article>
            <p>In prepping for my interviews for my <a href="/words/2012-09-25-from-n00b-to-engineer-in-one-year" title="N00b to engineer">newly acquired position</a> with Red Hat for the <a href="http://freeipa.org/page/Main_Page" title="FreeIPA">FreeIPA</a> project, I did my own crash course in studying net security/applied cryptography.  It&#39;s a very important subject, and I feel a lot of new developers rely on frameworks or libraries to implement this sort of &#39;stuff&#39; for them without knowing what&#39;s going on.  So for those who are oblivious (like I was) to NetSec topics and concerns, here is some lo-down.</p>

<p>Back when I was in banking, on my local desktop I had a password-protected Excel spreadsheet of logins &amp; passwords.  I thought I was one step above just saving my passwords in a plain-text file.  Since then, the bank has implemented a one-password storage system (although it added about 30 seconds for each system we wanted to log into).  A password-locked file is quite easy to break if someone wanted to.</p>

<p>Currently, it is expected that passwords are stored on systems not in plain text, known as hashes.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" title="Wiki: Hash Function">hash function</a> is used to produce a hash.  This type of function is considered &#39;one-way&#39;, where the hash algorithm will take a plain text phrase (e.g. a password, or anything like a name, social security number, etc) and put out a hash, but would not be able to reverse it - take the hash and put out the plain text.  If you put a hash into a hash function, you would get a new hash.  Common types of hash functions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" title="wiki: md5">MD5</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" title="Wiki: SHA-1">SHA-1</a>, [SHA-2][SHA2] </p>

<p>MD5: &quot;Message Digest Algorithm&quot; produces a 128-bit hash.  While it is still widely used, since 1996 flaws have been discovered, making it very conceivable to break hashes. SHA-1: &quot;Secure Hash Algorithm&quot; produces a 160-bit hash.  Also widely used but also has security flaws in the algorithm itself (found around 2005). </p>

<p>SHA-2: consists of 4 hash functions producing 244, 256, 384 or 512 bit hashes. While no attacks have been successful on SHA-2, its algorithm is similar to SHA-1.  It&#39;s still considered safe, but time is ticking. </p>

<p>These hash functions are still decent enough for message passing, just not password storage. Another hash algorithm, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" title="Wiki: Bcrypt">Bcrypt</a>, is thought to be more resistant to brute-force attacks.  This is because the algorithm adapts over time, basically lengthening the time it takes to create a hash, making it difficult to leverage increases in computer power. </p>
<h4>Two things to note with hash functions:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Don&#39;t implement your own hash function. Just don&#39;t.</li>
<li>Speed should not be a factor when hashing passwords.  Basically, the longer it takes to hash a password, the longer it takes for brute-force attacks.  Speedier algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1 is fine for message-passing and source verification, but not good for storing sensitive information. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Is a hash enough?</h4>
<p>No. Storing a hash of a password isn&#39;t enough.  If only a hash function is used to store a hash of plaintext, it&#39;d be pretty easy to break it. For instance, if your password was &#39;password&#39;, it would have the same hash value as someone else who also uses the same password.  If someone were to break into a database of hashed passwords, it&#39;d be very simple to do a quick frequency analysis, whichever hash is the most popular would probably be &#39;password&#39; or something like &#39;1234&#39;. This is essentially called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table" title="Wiki: Rainbow table">Rainbow Table</a>, a set of reverse-engineered hashed passwords.  It is reasonable (in the amount of time spent, aka brute force) to create a rainbow table of passwords up to about 8 characters in length. </p>
<h4>So then what now?</h4>
<p>In order to combat the ease of creating rainbow tables, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" title="Wiki: Salt">salt</a> is added to the password before it is hashed.  It is very important that this salt is used only once, and is unique per user/password. For instance, if you use &#39;password&#39; as your password, your salt could be (which would be decided behind the scenes) &#39;1\$0-1209-1!@fkjl&#39;, so the input for the hash algorithm would be &#39;password&#39;+&#39;1\$0-1209-1!@fkjl&#39;.  Your salt would not be used for anyone else&#39;s password.  So if someone else uses &#39;password&#39;, their salt would be something totally different, like &#39;sl;--90(d%&#39;, baring a different hash value for the same plaintext password. </p>
<h4>Side note</h4>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in the history of cryptography, breaking passwords and frequency analysis as well as a great history on computing, I would highly suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IK8PLE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004IK8PLE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=roglyn-20" title="The Code Book">The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography</a>. </p>

            <p>Hellz yea, I&#39;m a freaking engineer (sounds more hilarious in my head then it reads). Now who the hell wouldn&#39;t want to be an engineer? Fellow PyLady, Julia Grace, <a href="https://twitter.com/jewelia/status/262665853483499520" title="Tweet from Julia Grace">asked</a> about my expectations of being an engineer versus what I actually experienced.  </p>
<h4 id="tldr-it39s-awesome.">TL;DR: It&#39;s awesome.</h4>
<p>Here&#39;s the basic run down: </p>
<h4 id="asked-advice-from-systers-amp-devchix-mailing-list">Asked advice from Systers &amp; DevChix Mailing List</h4>
<p>(exact quotes, but leaving anonymous):</p>

<ul>
<li> Curiosity will keep you from becoming one of the &#39;not my job&#39; people.</li>
<li> Remember that a lot of engineers don&#39;t have the best people skills so some &#39;rude&#39; people are that way unintentionally.</li>
<li> If they dont answer questions, it is most likely because they dont know the answers.</li>
<li> Build relationships if possible. Never miss a happy hour type of thing.</li>
<li> &quot;Where did you learn that?&quot; is an interesting question</li>
<li> Figure out the ways in which you like to work- and others like to work- first.</li>
<li> Many guys truly don&#39;t think that women can or should be coding as equals.</li>
<li> At least 89% of the time, by the time I have really defined my question, I have figured out the answer.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="expectations-and-preformed-thoughts-amp-concerns">Expectations and Preformed Thoughts &amp; Concerns:</h4>
<ul>
<li> I would have to wind down my community engagements to an &#39;acceptable&#39; level, e.g. only x amount of non-Red Hat related conferences.</li>
<li> Thrown into code to fix a bug/patch/whatever</li>
<li> Spend wayyyy too much time thinking over a trivial aspect of said bug/patch/whatever.</li>
<li> Many naive questions from me, met with a poor/mean/unadjusted attitude, or worse, lack of any sort of emotional response (I&#39;d rather -know- I annoy you than wonder if you loathe my questions).</li>
<li> I&#39;d be restricted from doing certain things; &quot;when you&#39;re ready for it&quot; aka &quot;when I&#39;m ready to give this piece of my job up and move on to something better.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-set-expectations-formyself-too">I set expectations for <em>myself</em> too:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Learn this shit fast.</li>
<li> Be awesome.</li>
<li> Make a &#39;mark&#39; of myself (in terms of fixing bugs, finding errors in code or optimizing, helping users of the project, etc).</li>
<li> Learn faster than what is thrown at me.</li>
<li> Submit a patch by the end of the 3rd week (end of the 1st full week in Brno).</li>
<li> Maintain awesomeness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-the-first-few-weeks-actually-went">How the first few weeks actually went:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Crash course on LDAP &amp; Kerberos, how to create VMs both on my local machine and on remote servers (I feel dangerous now).</li>
<li><p>My last name <em>is</em> awesome.  However, sometimes I misread my terminal prompt:</p>

<p><code>[lroot @ remote-server] $ vim /accessible/by/root.conf<br>
Must be root to setup this server!<br>
/me what? I thought I...oh damn</code></p></li>
<li><p>Learning Linux machines like woah.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes just restarting does work.</p></li>
<li><p>Have achieved new levels of git-fu. (git rebase, squash &amp; reflog are a n00b&#39;s best tools)</p></li>
<li><p>Realized Macs are only popular for their GUIs and Aluminum casing (not giving mine up anytime soon, though)</p></li>
<li><p>These folks have a lot of patience for someone just learning like me.  Very comforting.</p></li>
<li><p>People don&#39;t need free meals/fish deliveries/spousal salaries upon death to be happy to work somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>It is SO freaking nice not to worry about being in the office during the same time as your manager (precious &#39;face time&#39;); clocking every minute of every hour that has any relation to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineers are so relaxed and fun to work with. I feel no pressure, and therefore no nerves when asking questions.  Little things like, &#39;here are the IRC channels we&#39;re in...&#39; and &#39;Thursday&#39;s the best because it&#39;s breakfast day.&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>My manager flat out said &quot;I won&#39;t read it&quot; when I forwarded him <a href="/2012-10-21-community-ftw-kicking-of-the-pycarolinas-community" title="Community FTW">my post</a> about the community talk I gave at PyCarolinas (among other questions &amp; discussion points). Damn that guy is awesome. No nonsense, no bs, no coddling, very helpful, thinks outside the box, and brilliant.</p></li>
<li><p>My manager also flat out said &quot;That&#39;s why we hired you&quot; when I asked him about being invited to speak at conferences. hellz yea.</p></li>
<li><p>I can surprise a few people with the little Czech knowledge I&#39;ve retained.  <em>&quot;jedno velky pivo, prosim.&quot;</em></p></li>
<li><p>I was assigned 5 tickets on day #2 in Brno. This will probably be the only time I will be excited to be assigned tickets. They seem to be the types of tickets that are &#39;easy pickens&#39; but also give the challenge of making you dig through the whole freaking code base only to find the issue comes from an outside package. /phew </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-devel/2012-October/msg00556.html">I SUBMITTED MY FIRST PATCH</a> (day #3 in Brno. 8 days of learning terms/code/git/processes, ignoring travel days, orientation, blah). <em>Side note: that patch broke everything. I learned a lesson in tests the following day.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cultural-differences">Cultural Differences:</h4>
<p>I was also <a href="https://twitter.com/juliaelman/status/262666318715707392%20" title="Julia Elman&#39;s tweet">asked</a> about what differences I&#39;ve seen in the engineering cultures, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/aesptux/status/262668691731263488" title="Adrian Espinosa&#39;s tweet">moving abroad experience</a> in general.  Immediately, my memory is refreshed on how hyper-sexualized women are dressed here.  I wear converse or pumas everyday -&gt; flag for &#39;I&#39;m not from here!&#39; as many women where heals (not crazy tall ones, although some do).  And hygiene can be an issue for some folks (lulz).  Also, while it&#39;s still relatively cheap in Czech Rep (2006: 22-24 Kc to 1 USD, now: 20 Kc to 1 USD), cost of living has gone up. Food is more expensive, housing, Ikea.</p>

<p>Immediate engineering culture differences are hard to pick up right now, and I hope to be able to have a better PoV after 2 months.  Every so often, I get a surprised look when I ask a question, giving me the impression that I&#39;m not as much of a n00b as was thought.  I think that more comes from the reputation that preceded me, the discussions that were had before I arrived.  I don&#39;t read into this at all.  I mean - no one told me to read into the package code before arriving... but I did, and it&#39;s<br>
helped a lot.  I haven&#39;t been approached inappropriately, scoffed at, or met with impatience.</p>

<p>All in all: this <em>job</em> lifestyle is utterly fantastic.  I got hired because I like to speak AND code AND continually learn. And I have expectations for myself to continue to speak AND code AND learn.  Look at that? all aligned! Just one drawback: I dream in test failures now.</p>

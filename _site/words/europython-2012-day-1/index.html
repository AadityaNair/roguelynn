        <article><p>If you&#39;re a Python enthusiast, and you&#39;re <strong>not</strong> at EuroPython, you&#39;re missing out, I&#39;m sorry to say.  Not only has the conference organizers put on a near flawless first day, they provided attendees with amazing food for thought with a fantastic program of keynotes to kick off the event.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/me_europython_slide.jpg" alt="Me EuroPython Slide" title="Me!"></p>

<p>Everyone was a bit start struck that Guido van Rossum was here; it&#39;s funny to see folks put him on a little bit of a pedestal when he&#39;s a normal nerd like the rest of us.  And naturally, he was wearing his favorite shirt: Python is for Girls.  (f&amp;ck yea!)</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Female attendance of EuroPython has <strong>doubled</strong> since last year, from 4% to 8%, while the overall attendance has increased about 100 people, or about 15% from last year (a rough estimate from collected conversations).</p>

<p>Guido&#39;s talk was very similar to his closing keynote at PyCon US this year, Not the State of the Union.  What I found more interesting was the moderated Q&amp;A he did towards the end of the day.  More on that in a second...</p>

<p><a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/p/alex-martelli" title="Alex Martelli">Alex Martelli</a> did a talk on the fantastic subject of Ask for Forgiveness, not for Permission, inspired by Grace Hopper.  It was very awesome and heart-warming to hear the crowd on twitter really welcome and embrace that line of thought, both because it&#39;s a great motto to live by (esp for engineers), as well as a very prominent and well-respected woman said it.  Only, he used Apple&#39;s version of Comic Sans on his slides: Chalkboard.  Not that forgivable... (although I&#39;ve committed that crime as well in my Python study group slides *hides head in shame*).</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t realize that Martelli was the author of Python in a Nutshell, and co-edited w/ this wife, Anna, the Python Cookbook. I should have lugged that door stopper to get it signed!</p>

<p>Next, <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/p/febo-cincotti" title="febo Cincotti">Febo Cincotti</a> presented on the progression neuroscience has made in allowing those who have absolutely no way to communicate without the help of computers in his talk titled &quot;Let your Brain talk to Computers.&quot;  While not Python-centric, it was very inspirational and detailed on how far science has come with respect to helping those like Stephen Hawking in the &#39;locked-in&#39; state.</p>

<p>Naturally, it wouldn&#39;t be a Python conference without a state of the PyPy endeavor and a GIL-less future by <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/p/armin-rigo" title="Armin Rigo">Armin Rigo</a>, <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/p/antonio-cuni" title="Antonio Cuni">Antonio Cuni</a>, and <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/p/maciej-fijalkowski" title="Maciej Fijalkowski">Maciej Fijalkowski</a>.  I really enjoyed this talk mostly because these gentlemen had such a dorky, academic/scientist-like passion about the progression of PyPy.  Their story came off as very inspiring, honest, and enthusiastic about the massive undertaking of a project.  It was interesting that Armin even spent some time making his own Python interpreter (seriously, how passionate &amp; dedicated is he?).  It will be great to see how these gentlemen progress with Transactional Memory &amp; Automatic Mutual Exclusion.  Fascinating.</p>

<p>An unexpected highlight of the evening was the quality of some lightning talks.  Specifically, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/llanga" title="Lukasz Langa">Lukasz Langa</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lukaszlanga/i-regret-nothing" title="I Regret Nothing">I Regret Nothing, You can&#39;t judge me</a>.  Full of hilarious memes, fast-paced jokes, and honest confession of his horrible habits, Mr Llanga showed EuroPython just how lazy of a Python programmer he is.  From simplified and nearly unidentifiable variables, to multiple inheritance, to horrific monkey patching, he convinced the audience that a) he&#39;s lazy, b) he doesn&#39;t regret it and c) god bless your soul if you inherit his code.</p>

<p>To wrap up the evening, Guido van Rossum did a casual but well attended moderated Q&amp;A.  He was quite frank in answering his questions, from &quot;I just don&#39;t know what this person is asking&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m not going to waste my time answering this.&quot;  My next post will be the loosely transcribed conversation, after I refactor it a bit to actually be readable.  But believe me when I say that while Guido is quite tired of the same question, &quot;Looking back, what would you do differently&quot;, he&#39;s a fantastic sport that offers great dialogue for us in the Python community.  So stay tuned!</p>

When trying to develop my talk, during my procrastination/conference-driven-development, I tried to understand and uncover the inherit qualities of the Python community. But first I had to step back: <em>why</em> is community important?

                    <p>What a blast I had on Saturday!  It was a great learning experience for both the attendees and for us PyLadies org board!  Good lessons learned, such as virtualenv is a beast to install depending on one&#39;s operating system.  Next time, we&#39;ll have a pre-workshop session for installation of dependencies and such. We went through how to build a blog using Django and its class-based views.  We also went over Model-View-Controller concepts, and how they apply to Django.  We wrapped up with a quick overview of how easy it is to deploy an application on Heroku (way too easy!).   <a href="/words/pyladies-first-workshop-build-your-own-blog/" class='more-link'>Read more &rarr;</a></p>

                    <p>Wow, what an event it was! I&#39;d say we had about ~50 attendees for our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pyladiessf" title="Event Page">first event</a>, which is awesome.  There was so much excitement in the room that I couldn&#39;t even get a chance to hack on my projects!    <a href="/words/update-pyladiessf-debut/" class='more-link'>Read more &rarr;</a></p>

I should post more so I don&#39;t have to do such a digest of what&#39;s been going on! :) It all started when I took my first CS class.   Well, it sucked. Learning first in C, I thought, “Well, I know some of these words.” I [re]assure you, C does not come naturally to a (former) financial analyst.  I felt<br>

                    <p>Has anyone else heard of BitCoin, and the incredible inflation it has seen? This <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/05/29/why-im-putting-all-my-savings-into-bitcoin/" title="Why I&#39;m Putting All my Savings into Bitcoin">dude</a> has put <strong>all</strong>his money into BitCoin - not smart, I would say.  Especially when <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=21877" title="Run on Bitcoin">news</a> like a run on BitCoin hits. (If you have no clue on what BitCoin is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" title="Wiki: Bitcoin">read</a>.) So while I laugh at the guy who invested all his money that is now gone, I reflect back on a conversation I had with a friend a few years ago.  Can we use this virtual currency to study monetary economics?  BitCoin has the potential to provide us with an interesting avenue to understand another type of currency. But what I am imagining more is looking at virtual worlds and video games (disclaimer: I have no direct experience with video games) to build scenarios to &quot;test&quot; on live people interacting with the world/game.  Currently, there are trading simulators that follow the market where one can see how his/her virtual portfolio would fair in real life.  Add that aspect to a virtual economy and see how quantitative easing programs could affect it. Just an idea.  <a href="/words/studying-bitcoin/" class='more-link'>Read more &rarr;</a></p>

                    <p>I had the interesting experience of attending a Seattle tech talk with Facebook&#39;s Mark Zuckerberg. Unfortunately I was too scared to ask him if he felt $70 billion was a fair value for the FB IPO estimate, or if he needed any analysts to help him justify such a number.  <a href="/words/seattle-tech-talk/" class='more-link'>Read more &rarr;</a></p>

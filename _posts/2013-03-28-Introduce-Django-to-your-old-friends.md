Django 1.5 introduced a configurable User model, fantastic! Now what? With the increased flexibility of user models, integrating Django into an existing infrastructure is now easier than ever. This talk gives an introduction to the new configurable User model, and then walks through how to integrate Django applications to authenticate against already existing identity management systems like LDAP, Kerberos, etc.

With the launch of [newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io), I reflected on how many want to learn to code, and many choose Python as a first language. We direct them to Learn Python the Hard Way, or Dive into Python. Great! But now what? I launched 5 digestible projects to gradually progress the Python learner from near drowning to a decent swimmer. The goal is to have new coders feeling accomplished and to continuing learning.

An insomniac software engineer for Red Hat, founder of the [San Francisco Chapter][meetup] of [PyLadies][pyladies], board member of the [Python Software Foundation][psf]. 

I have a business degree in finance and economics, but fell in love with programming in 2011. I work on [freeIPA][freeipa], particularly on integrating the product into other Open Source projects.

I like to speak. A [lot][talks]. I particularly talk on the Python community, as well as the work that I do with freeIPA integration. [Email][email] me if you would like to make my talks list longer.

I respond to [twitter][twitter] faster than [email][email].

I [vent][blog] sometimes. My personal projects can be found on [GitHub][github].

Writings and thoughts on this site are my own.

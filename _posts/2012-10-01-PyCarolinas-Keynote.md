I was honored when [Calvin Spealman](http://twitter.com/ironfroggy) invited me to keynote on the topic of community.  He wanted folks to leave feeling inspired to build up the area's sense of community.  A lot of pressure, but having a conference is a damn good litmus test to understand a local area's Python community.
